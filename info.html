          This website was built for fun. I was in a business class and a project we had was to "start" a food truck, so for bonus points I decided to make a website for it. It was in doing this that I learned about Github and how to make my own website, so after the project I built it. I had several games that we had made in coding club so I decided to put them on the website, and slowly it grew. I had a friend of mine write an article(How to get the girls), which I also put up here. In late March early April of 2025 I did a complete overhaul of the design and layout. Before the overhaul it just consisted of the login page which lead to the home page which had buttons for all of the different pages. I added the Games, Articles, Home, and Site info tabs. In my opinion the new layout is much mor organized, cleaner, and Professional looking.
