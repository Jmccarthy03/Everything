    Welcome, future financial mogul! Are you interested in running a successful bank without any prior experience, qualifications, or, say, legal ownership of the institution? You’ve come to the right place. Here’s your definitive guide to running a bank you don’t technically own—but you do have the keys to the vault, and isn’t that ownership in its purest form?

Step 1: Dress for the Job You Want
First impressions matter. If you stroll in wearing a ski mask and gloves, people might get suspicious. Instead, opt for a sharp suit, maybe some glasses for that “I understand compound interest” look. Carry a clipboard. Clipboards are 87% more convincing than weapons.

Step 2: Establish Authority Immediately
March into the lobby like you’ve just been sent by the Federal Reserve itself. Use phrases like, “Per my last embezzlement—err, investment report,” or “I’ll need the manager’s office cleared. I’m feng-shui-ing the assets.” People rarely question confident nonsense.

Step 3: Learn the Lingo
Throw around banking terms like “liquidity,” “fiscal responsibility,” and “diversifying the getaway car routes.” If someone asks what you’re doing in the vault, tell them you’re conducting an “aggressive fiscal withdrawal.” That should buy you ten to fifteen minutes—or ten to fifteen years, depending on the judge.

Step 4: Reinvent the ATM
Automated Teller Machines are so last century. You’re launching a new concept: the HATM—Hand-Assisted Teller Movement. Just hold out a large sack and ask the teller to deposit everything in it. Branding is key.

Step 5: Exit Strategy is Everything
All great CEOs have an exit plan. Yours just happens to involve the back alley, a motorcycle, and a guy named Rick who “owes you one.” Keep your escape agile and your excuses rehearsed: “I thought this was my bank,” or, “I was simply consolidating my assets into a single, highly mobile portfolio.”

Conclusion: Ownership is a Mindset
Remember: it’s not theft if you believe in yourself hard enough. Running a bank is about confidence, vision, and making bold moves—preferably before the cops show up. So go forth, future executive of other people’s savings. Just don’t forget to shred this article before court.
